Tic Tac Toe
===========
Not much to say here. `cd` into the main directory and just
`python run.py`. Currently, the AI is tragically stupid. It just
picks a random square. I might make it smarter later.

Also the implementation is ugly and full of branches. I coded
this while I was stuck on an NJTransit train that stalled in a tunnel
near Hoboken.
